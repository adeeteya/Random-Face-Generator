<i>Random Face Generator</i> is a flutter app to generate random faces. The Generated faces do not actually exist in real life (in other words you could catfish without getting in trouble ☺ – jk jk pls don't catfish).

Each image has been pre-analyzed by an AI algorithm called <a href='https://github.com/aristofun/py-agender' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>pypy-agender</a> to identify the gender and age.

Anti-features: NonFreeNet - This app uses the <a href='https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>thispersondoesnotexist</a> and the <a href='https://hankhank10.github.io/fakeface/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>fakeface</a> API.
